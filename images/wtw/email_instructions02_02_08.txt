Jim, I love the red; love the font, love the shadow picture of him in the red robe. Would really prefer the other picture in the red box: the one with his right hand/pointed index finger as the one on the home page. That's his "signature" picture, he loves that one. The gray-hair one looks old :-). Yes, he's old now, but I'd rather make his primary home pic reflect his better days. [OR have the pic I want first, and below that, the one you have there--kinda' a then/now...? And since they point in opposite directions...? Might be interesting. Hmmm...I don't know. Maybe too congested.] Since I don't have much text on the home page, I'm okay with a good, larger image of the finger point picture.
    Because the shadow picture and the picture I want has him ~facing the same direction, do you want to move the red shadow pic to the other side (maybe flip it? make a little smaller?), and just slide the menu links and the red box over to the right? Also, the cross there is too ornate, or maybe just too dominant. [Hmmm--with the finger point picture, he could be pointing toward (a smaller) cross? A cross is a good idea, but that one is too big/dominant :-)]
    Are you thinking to carry a smaller of the shadow pic onto each page? Just a thought. [??]
    And, I would need his name to include Rev. Dr. on the same line.
    Call if you want, before proceeding--up to you. not necessary. Overall, good/great concept. I'm looking forward to the rest.  I'm really excited.
