Jim, I am in Phoenix, so I didn't proof everything with a fine tooth comb. But just a few obvious things I noticed at first glance:
 
1) Overall, great. Looks good. but:
2) In the 'menu' links: it should be photos, not "photo's" It's a plural, not a possessive; so, NO apostrophe;
3) Please center the Copyright at the bottom; and I usually like the word Copyright there, in addition to the symbol...;
4) When I opened "About," a large shadow image of him in the red robe appeared [~scrolled in], covering the text. This also happened on the 'little known facts' page. [??] I was asking for a small fixed photo of him in the right upper hand corner. For now, just stop that pop-up fade-in of the overlay photos on those two pages, cuz you can't read what's there. I'll decide which photo to put ther when I can think about it; [maybe the striped-jacket podium pic, or the one we use on the home page in the red box.]
5) The "Music Tree" caption--there is a line space beween the words "Judson" and Press." Don't need it.
6) I'd say move the Canaan Bapt Church picture AND that quote about Jesse UP, and put his older picture [left hand extended; gray hair,beard] and the more recent quotes about Rosa Parks dying and the Obama prospect to the bottom, since they are most recent. Make the Obama quote the last one.
7) On the 'Little known facts page', my second paragraph isn't there.

That's it for now; and again, this is a cursory review as I'm off to a class. But tweak those things for now and I'll get back with you when I return to Atlanta Tuesday (likely Wednesday, I'll contact you). THANK YOU.  I didn't spell check this. sorry. rushing. Ciao! And WyattTeeWalker.com is the primary domain that's active, right? The other two forward to it...yes? Ciao.
