<DIV>It seems someone breached this site. It seems that what I had here before (i.e., how to contact the good reverend) was somehow removed.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>IF anyone wishes to email the good reverend through this site, you need to know that I can forward your info. BUT it has come to my attention that the Mrs.&nbsp;has tried to disparage my name solely because, two years ago I needed to talk to someone about what happened to me when I was a sixteen year old, looking for Jesus at CBC,&nbsp;and someone "took me under" his wing in ways beyond the call of duty. When I needed to discuss this privately (with the violator), no one would let me. For years. My letters were all intercepted and I was told that because someone "is old now," that I should just let it go. No, no. I had to "go on blast" and notify the Mrs directly...with details and&nbsp;pictures.&nbsp;She then&nbsp;tried to disparage <EM>me</EM> for deeds done by someone much older than me and in a "position of authority." That is unacceptable. She needed to <EM>thank me</EM> that it was only of late that I sought to speak about what happened. If I had said something earlier, the life of at least six people would have been a LOT different, to say nothing of a congregation. </DIV>

<DIV>Freedom Rider, yes; Civil rights leader, yes. Pastor, yes. But also...[shall we say] one who crossed MAJOR moral, ethical boundaries with a young parishioner. I decided to no longer protect someone who violated me.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I will remove this info soon. Again, it seems that what I had here before (i.e., how to contact the good reverend) was somehow removed. Hmmm. Because of the apparent breach, what&nbsp;I have here now is more telling than what I had here before. As a result,&nbsp;I will not provide any contact info at this time.</DIV>
