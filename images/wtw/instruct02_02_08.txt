--The pictures work well like that. Good.
 
--I want the Home page text, as given. I can't list all his awards, but I want to mention that he has them, so keep all that in there [...Human Rights Activist. Recipient of numerous honors and awards...Christ. And that's just for starters.] I want it as I gave it.
 
--I do not want those quotes on his home page; we'll keep those for the left vertical column of quotes alongside the About page.  In the red box, you can put this one: "The Black Church is the American fruit of an African root." (Somebody's Calling My Name, 1979)
 
--I want the five menu links, as requested--yes, the "Little Known Facts" link. I want to get that set up now; easier later. Remember, "Quotes" is not a page of itself; they'll run along the About (chronology) page. SO, the links are: Home. About. Photos. Little Known Facts. Contact Us.
 
--You can omit these quotes from the list--the ones beginning with: "My father..." "I woke up Christmas morning..." and "Because of your visit..." Keep the others.
 
--Re: the cross: that one's better; but look at this page [see link]--the black one with the ~white center lines (it's on the last line, next to the yellow cross). Can you do something like that, and 1) keep the cross black; make the "whitish" area gold, and put much of the cross in a thiin black-rim circle, leaving a portion of the lower vertical part outside the circle? I ask this because that would sort of resemble the cross emblem Canaan uses. The empty spaces in the circle can be the red background in that box you made?, or white [?] http://www.clipart.com/en/search/split?page=5&width=600&a=a&b=k&batch=15&sh=&q=crosses&total=2886&k_mode=all
 
--And, on the photos page, the pics don't have to be real big; up to you. What's average, 2.5-3 inches each? And a click for larger view? Re: their layout--I saw something the other day and it looked nice: some pics were to the left, some to the right [alternating left margin pic; right margin pic] and the caption was alongside the photo (or underneath). Or, randomly placed on the page. Whatever. Up to you.
 
Okay, GREAT! But keep my home page text. keep my links and have fun!!
