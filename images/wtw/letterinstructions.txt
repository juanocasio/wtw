Good Wednesday to you, Jim:
 
Okay...For now, this will just be a basic site, no major bells/whistles. I'm thinking 6 menu links (maybe five [better?], if you think the "Quotes" page can go somewhere else--maybe at the end of the ABOUT page??).
    And, I'm kinda' thinking to play some old gospel music on the photos page. How would I send that to you? And perhaps have a "Music, On/Off" click for viewers.
 
The pages I've got are:
HOME. ABOUT. QUOTES. LITTLE KNOWN FACTS. PHOTOS. CONTACT.
 
**I will want a good photo on his home page, of course. I'm thinking the one with his finger pointing...if it transmits well. If not that one, maybe the one in the red robe.
 
**And on the other pages, use another smaller photo in the upper right hand corner, like on my site.
 
**I only see three possible internal links to another area within the site:
1)Photo page--a link there to the Contact page, in case someone wants to send me some photos;
2)Contact Page: Creating the "Upload photo" stuff, to make that happen. See notes on that page to see what info would be needed to accompany each photo;
3) Contact page (Comments area): a place for folks to send me a comment about him; maybe limit space to 100 words? OR should I just include the request for any comments to go to the general email? [That might be easier in the long run]. I do not want any photos or comments to automatically appear on the site; I'd want to screen them, esp. since I'm not sure I'll include any of them.]
 
** I really would like--and need--for the first letters of his names to show as 'caps,' since there are so many "T's". WyattTeeWalker.com is easier to read than wyattteewalker.com .
 
**FYI: I have additionally reserved www.WyattTWalker.com and www.WyattTee.com I will want those domains to forward to the full name domain/site: WyattTeeWalker.com
 
**Later today I will call Network Solutions to activate the site and forward those other names.
 
**I'll send photos separately, a few per each attachment. You can just space the photos out randomly on that Photo page. Attached to this, is the copy for the site. [Do you want me to, also, paste that into an email? I forgot how we did it before].
 
**OH! RED is his favorite color. Red; gold; black. So we need to have red accents throughout (or, the menu link boxes be red, with black/white letters or ???) I know red is supposed to be hard on the eyes online [? Doesn't really bother me], but it is his key color, so it must be.
 
I'm running out now, back around 4 PM. I'll shoot photos to you then.
 
Thanks,
Melody
