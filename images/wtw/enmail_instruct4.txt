Hello, Jim:
    Now that I've printed out the site, a few tech glitches, some omissions and a few typos. I bolded most of what I'm talking about (not to be bolded on the site, just for this purpose):
 
HOME PAGE:
--When printed out, The "Rev. Dr...." is cut off, and runs into the menu links.
 
--You need to resize [?], or elongate [?], cuz the right side of the page is cut off. 1)We lose half his body in the robe, 2) the right side of the black border is gone and 3) the "copyright" footer is cut off at the "g" in "rights."
 
--You omitted "Recipient of numerous honors and awards" in the sentence. It should read: The Harlem Preacher. Renaissance Man. Civil Rights Leader. Human Rights Activist. Recipient of numerous honors and awards and 37-year Pastor--now Pastor Emeritus--of Harlem's Canaan Baptist Church of Christ.
 
--Before, you had his "Rev. Dr. ...Walker" name with a shadow effect. That was nice. Can you put that back (especially since you need to resize it now)...?
 
--The quote should read "...of an African root." [My mistake]
 
ABOUT Page:
 
--Re: Dec. 24, 1950...[married Theresa Ann]. After that, I'd put They later had four children.
 
--Punctuation missing: You need to put semicolons [;] at the end of the lines C.1950's ...Dr. Martin Luther King...The March 24, 1968, ending with TN.  and the Attica Security Prison...riots; the 1993 Ebony magazine line needs closing quotation marks after "...Preachers." [and, 2nd page of About]: the "2004" line needs a semicolon.
 
--You need to join together Dec. 1966-Aug. 1967. [Those dates go together, where he served as interim minister of CBC]. As is right now, "Dec. 1966-- is standing alone, without anything.
 
PHOTOS page:
 
--Is it possible to further approximate the bottom line to the top line in the caption under the Music Tree? There is a gap between those two lines (between Name and Judson Press. ALSO, Put italics onto the book title, Somebody's Calling My Name.
 
LITTLE KNOWN FACTS page:
 
--Before "Stay tuned!", insert the phrase And what's in a name--his name?
--Also, his photo is off the page, when printed. He cuts off at the crotch/midline.
 
CONTACT US page:
 
--His photo is off the page; all you see is the finger pointing.
*********************************************************
General questions:
1) I think I like the Copyright in the center...and it needs to carry though on all pages.
2) Can you omit ""Dr." in the top header [blue] bar of the site...? Does that make a difference when someone does a search...? [Wyatt Tee Walker Home] [Wyatt Tee Walker About], etc. AND get rid of your apostrophe in the word Photos in the header on those Photos pages.
3) How can I get this site to appear high/early when a search is done on Google, etc...?
4) I'm wondering if we should write out his full name in some captions, that way they'd appear when an image search is done for him. 'Wyatt Tee Walker." Maybe just the first two, and the striped jacket pics.

What do I need your address for? [LOL] I'll mail your $$ tomorrow ;-) Watch for it next week. And, I'll get the other stuff to you next week (tweaks to my site, etc.) THANK YOU--Melody
